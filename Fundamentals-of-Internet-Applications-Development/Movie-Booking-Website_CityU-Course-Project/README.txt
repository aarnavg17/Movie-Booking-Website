This project is for the course, CS2204 - Fundaments of Internet Application Development, in City University of Hong Kong.
We were required to make a movie booking website, with only using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. i.e., PHP, NodeJS, and other tools were not allowed to be used. Apart from that, we had few requirements to fulfil, such as animated logo on each page, specific content provided to us, etc.
